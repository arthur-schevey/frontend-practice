# Astro Playground

Why do I use Astro?
It allows me to easily use a variety of technologies within my project.

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

### HTML Files
They are `.astro` files found in `src/<project>`.

### Supporting Files
Other static assets like images or css files will be found in `public/<project>`.

## ðŸ§ž If you want to run this locally

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
